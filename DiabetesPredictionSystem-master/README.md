# Diabetes Prediction System
The project uses Machine Learning techniques to Predict Diabetes according to different parameters as provided in the "Pima Indians Diabetes Database" dataset. The datasets consist of several medical predictor variables and one target variable, Outcome. Predictor variables includes the number of pregnancies of the patient has had, their BMI, Insulin Level, Age, and so on.
## Approach
###  1) Machine Learning: -
Feature like "Outcome" is dropped from dataset and stored for doing the predictions after which the data is feed into the ML models to train/test data.
## Read and follow the instructions carefully.
## Packages Used: -
*	Scikit-Learn.
*	Numpy
*	Pandas
*	Matplotlib
*	Seaborn
*	Python 3.8.0
## Raw data:
Download "Pima Indians Diabetes Database" from https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database the Raw dataset is of 9KB csv file.
## Working of Project
*	First Make sure that you have all the packages mentioned above installed in your model’s directory.
*	And then Download the Code file and Run it on PyCharm.
*	Then Change the paths mentioned in the code file according to your pc and then in the terminal write "python manage.py runserver”.
## Conclusion
After using the Logistic Regression method to train/test the dataset the accuracy of the model is around 80%.
